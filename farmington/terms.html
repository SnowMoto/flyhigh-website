                    <h3>Booking Online</h3>
                    <p>There are two ways to pay for a booking. You can
                        either make a direct payment for each booking
                        individually or you can upload credit to an account
                        from which you can allocate funds to bookings. To
                        make a payment you can use either a credit card or a
                        debit card (Roller only accepts Visa and
                        Mastercard).</p>
                    <p>You will be provided with an automatically generated
                        email receipt of all monetary transactions made
                        through Roller.</p>
                    <p>Upon making a direct payment for an online booking,
                        or using existing credit that has been uploaded to
                        your account, you will be charged a 3% transaction
                        fee that is not recoverable under any
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p>If you upload credit, the amount will remain in your
                        account until such time as it is either used by you
                        for a booking or withdrawn by you (see withdrawals
                        below). This account will also be used for any
                        refunds that you may be entitled to (see refunds
                        below).</p>
                    <p>If you are entitled to a refund, the amount of refund
                        will be credited directly to this account. You can
                        check the status of your account balance at all
                        times by logging into your account. Alternatively,
                        you can email Roller directly if you have any
                        queries regarding your account status (<a
                            href="mailto:info@rollerdigital.com">info@rollerdigital.com</a>).</p>
                    <p>All unused funds in your account are held on trust
                        for you by Roller until such time as you decide to
                        withdraw those funds or use them to pay for a
                        booking.</p>

                    <h3>Booking Over The Phone/E-mail</h3>
                    <p>Deposits or full payments can be paid via Cash, Bank
                        Transfer or Credit Card/Debit Card. The amount
                        required is dependent on the terms of the
                        reservation. If you require a receipt, please
                        request directly from Fly High by contacting <a

                    <p>All cancellation and refund policies are provided to

                        via email.</p>
                    <p>If you have a dispute regarding the amount of the

                        High you accept and acknowledge the risk that you
                        may be evicted from the venue for failing to comply
